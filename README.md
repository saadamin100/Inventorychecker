 I’ve developed a streamlined Automated Inventory Intelligence Tool that turns raw data into actionable insights with zero manual cleaning.
The Problem: Most businesses lose time fixing inconsistent data formats and miss out on stock opportunities due to delayed reporting.
The Solution: A hybrid system that leverages the power of Python for backend automation and Power BI for high-end visualization.
Key Features of the Tool:
Automated Data Pipeline: Built with Python (Pandas) to handle data cleaning and structural fixes instantly.
Dynamic Inventory Tracking: Real-time visibility into Total Stock Value, Category Distribution, and SKU health.

Proactive Alerts: Visual signals for Low Stock and Out-of-Stock items to prevent supply chain gaps.

Interactive Analytics: Drill-down tables and KPI cards for a 360-degree view of warehouse operations.

This tool is designed to help businesses move from "Manual Entry" to "Data-Driven Decisions."

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | Power BI | Data Modeling
